# ScriptDomVisualizer

Using the Microsoft TSql Script Dom to generate code is quite hard as you need to know what types of objects you need to put into the AST at the right place and I usually end up nose deep in a debugger trying to remember property names and types.

This is a simple tool that lets you put in some t-sql and see what types / properties are needed to use the Script Dom to create the object you would like.

Nothing earth shattering but saves me time :)
